Contains Multimodal datasets:

Each correct loop closure is augmented with an outlier and a null
component. 

_MM_1* contains 1 incorrect loop closure and 1 null component for every
correct loop closure. Hence each loop closure edge has 3 components.

_MM_2* contains 2 incorrect loop closures and 1 null component for every
correct loop closure. Hence each loop closure edges has 4 components.

The corresponding unimodal datasets are named _NN_1* and _NN_2*
respectively. 

These datasets were created just to form a reference to create other
multimodal datasets - experiments.
